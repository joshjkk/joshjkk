## 🧐 About Me 🧐

Hey, I'm Joshua Kinder, a regular 15 year-old from the UK 🇬🇧. I'd like to say that I code for fun, but to be honest, I don't even know why I do it anymore. Programming has had me captivated since the age of 13, and I still can't rip myself away from it. I use [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) and C for my projects.
