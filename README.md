## 🧐 About Me 🧐

Hey, I'm Joshua Kinder from the UK 🇬🇧. I've been programming since 12, (15 now) because being able to make the computer do crazy stuff by typing on a crusty keyboard has always fascinated me. 

## 🖥 My OS 🖥

- Dual Boot: Windows 10 + Ubuntu Linux

I have a [dual-boot](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/d/dualboot.htm) system with [Windows 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10) for personal use and [Ubuntu Linux](https://ubuntu.com/) for programming.

## 🐍 My Programming Languages 🐍

- C
- Python

I have tampered with many programming languages in the past, but my main ones are probably [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) and [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), C because of the speed and Python in case I cant make it in C.

and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or sometimes [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) for my code editor.
