## 🧐 About Me 🧐

Hey, my name is Joshua Kinder, I'm an IT enthusiast and [Greek Orthodox Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodoxy) from the UK. I have been programming since the age of 12, starting out with [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), eventually working my way up to [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)), [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and currently my favourite: [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)).

## 🖥️ My Operating System 🖥️

### Arch Linux

I use [Arch Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux), or more specifically [EndeavourOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EndeavourOS) for personal and work needs because Linux is much better for programming than [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows).

## 🔠 My Main Programming Language 🔠

### C Language

[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) is my favourite language of all time and for good reasons. Why make something in [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), when you can make it in C? [The speed of C](https://github.com/niklas-heer/speed-comparison) is flawless, and just about anything is possible with it. Truly a great language.

## ⌨️ My Text Editor ⌨️

### Neovim

I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) as my text editor because it's fast, free and customizable. I can also use [VSCode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code), but I much prefer the Vim motions and VSCode is a little slow on my system.
